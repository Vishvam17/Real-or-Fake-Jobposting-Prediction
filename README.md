## About Data Set.
- This dataset contains 18K job descriptions out of which about 800 are fake. 
- The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs. 
- The dataset can be used to create classification models which can learn the job descriptions which are fraudulent.
- Dataset can be found here :- https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction

## Inspiration 
The dataset is very valuable as it can be used to answer the following questions:
- Create a classification model that uses text data features and meta-features and predict which job description are fraudulent or real.
- Identify key traits/features (words, entities, phrases) of job descriptions which are fraudulent in nature.
- Run a contextual embedding model to identify the most similar job descriptions.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset to identify interesting insights from this dataset.

## About the Model
- The Sequential Neural Network was used for better prediction.
